# Easy Form Validation with Mobx + Typescript

Using this project, you can have really easy form validations with Mobx.
You only have to create a Store, extending **AbstractFormState**, and declare validations for every field.
The validation library used is: [ValidatiorJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validatorjs)

Custom Validations are supported.

We get autocomplete for free.

## How to use it
Run `npm i` and then `npm start`

Go to `LoginForm.tsx` and `ComplexForm.tsx` to understand it, is very easy.
